Installation instructions for cluster-delegator
-----------------------------------------------

== Prerequisites

This package requires Open-MPI and Boost

(For installation of prerequisites on Mac OS X, see below)

== Installation 

From the cluster-delegator directory, type

./install.sh --prefix=<install-prefix>

If <install-prefix> is omitted then /usr/local is assumed.
If /usr/local cannot be written into, then ~/.local is used 
if it exists. Otherwise the script fails.

Use "sudo" if there are permission problems or else choose
an install directory you have permissions to write to.

The software is header only. The only thing the installer does
is copy header files to 

<install-prefix>/include/delegator

Examples:

Suppose /usr/local is system-write only:

sudo ./install.sh             # installs to /usr/local
./install.sh                  # installs to ~/.local (if it exists)
./install.sh --prefix=~/Work  # installs to ~/Work

On the other hand if /usr/local can be written into without permissions (for instance if you are using Homebrew on Mac OS X this is the case) then

./install.sh 

should install into /usr/local.
